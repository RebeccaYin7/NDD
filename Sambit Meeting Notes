11-16 Sambit Meeting
Goal: to determine reason behind slow code 

List Comprehension
- replace for i in range(len(est_nodes))

replace sklearn use with numba used instead
- particularly with large matrix multiplication
- will make faster

nested for loops slow down the code 
- got rid of iteration over pis 

Parallelized def: run all at same time (of for loop) on different cores

mi function
- only calculated for one forest
- estimate_mi run only once after tree is built

Sambit previous testing 
- train RF
- compute similarity matrix (if two obs in same leaf node - similar) 
- over all trees to get matrix
- compute eucl distance (matrix)
- calculate test stat

For me: 
- train forest & est_mi = test stat
- p value: permute input 1000x, test stat
- estimate_mi, no iterating through pi's 
- every time for test stat, train new forest (using uf) but only calculate mi once
